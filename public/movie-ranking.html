<h1>Best Movies According to Aaron</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Edward Scissorhands</h3>
<p>Beautiful music, a lot of metaphor and meaning can be derived from it. Manages to be moody but also funny.</p>
<h3>Digimon The Movie</h3>
<p>Look... it just hits hard, okay? Music is nostalgic, the concept is cool, time travel, mourning, healing, friendship, what more can you ask for?</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>So much great content. Lots to talk about post movie and appreciate when rewatched, really interesting ideas. It's a movie I'll always be down to watch.</p>
